code uses loops, alerts, prompts, functions ect to generate a random password generator. 
Password generator sends prompts to user asking how many  characters, if they want numbers, symbols and Lower & Uppercase letters to be used in their password.
Characters go through loop to generate random charcaters and number of characters goes through a for loop and generates a random password based on users preferences of number of characters.
